## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Binary streaming for FsWriteFile protocol.** This feature allows for more efficient writing of large files (>5MB) by using binary frames instead of base64 encoded text frames, reducing bandwidth overhead by ~33%.
- **Disk-backed buffering on the server.** The server now uses `NamedTempFile` for buffering `fsWriteFile` chunks, preventing memory spikes for large saves.
- **Client-side binary transport.** Updated `ws-transport.ts` to support the hybrid JSON+Binary frame protocol.
- **Improved Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC).** mtime and size enforcement are now more robust and verified with extensive tests.

### Fixed
- **Large file RAM spike during saves.** Previously, the server buffered all chunks in RAM, leading to potential OOM for large files.

### Changed
- **Default encoding for large file writes.** Switched from base64 text frames to binary WebSocket frames for better efficiency.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Monaco Editor integration.** Full-featured editor with syntax highlighting and tab management.
- **3-phase WebSocket write protocol.** Robust `begin -> chunks -> commit` flow for file saving.
- **File tiering.** Automatic handling of different file types and sizes (normal, degraded, large, binary).
- **Mtime-guarded atomic writes.** Prevents data loss during concurrent edits.
- **ConflictDialog.** User-friendly handling of save conflicts (overwrite vs reload).
- **LargeFileViewer.** Efficient viewing of files > 5MB via range reads.
- **BinaryPreview.** Hex dump viewer for binary files.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **IDE Shell layout.** Responsive layout using `react-resizable-panels`.
- **Live file tree.** Syncs in real-time with filesystem changes.
- **TanStack Query hooks.** Robust data fetching and FS subscription management.
- **Feature-gated /ide route.**

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **File watcher.** notify-based real-time notifications for file system events.
- **WebSocket event push.** Efficiently pushes FS events to connected clients.
- **inotify-based debouncing.** Prevents event storms on large file changes.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **IDE File Explorer REST API.** Endpoints for listing, reading, and stating files.
- **Filesystem sandbox.** Secure path validation to prevent traversal.
- **Binary file detection.** Automatic identification of binary files using MIME guessing.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Initial release of DamHopper.
- Workspace management and project auto-discovery.
