- [x] Added ServerConfig to config schema with session_persistence, session_db_path, session_buffer_ttl_hours
- [x] Parse [server] section in config loader
- [x] Initialize SessionStore in main.rs when enabled
- [x] 6 unit tests passing (all CRUD operations covered)
- [x] Code review score: 9/10 (after critical fixes)
- [x] Security: Database file permissions (0o600), SQL injection prevention
- [x] Files: 12 files created/modified, ~480 lines

**Phase 05: Persist Worker (Planned)**
- [ ] Implement background worker for periodic session snapshots
- [ ] Buffer flushing to SQLite on configurable interval
